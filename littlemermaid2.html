            <h1>
                The Original Tale of The Little Mermaid 
            </h1>
            <p>The original tale follows a similar storyline to many of the adaptations we know and love today: a young mermaid longs to leave the gloomy depths of the ocean and join the humans above the waves. After saving a handsome prince from drowning, she sacrifices her voice to a sea witch, in order to be with her beloved on dry land. In Andersen’s version, the sea witch cuts out the mermaid’s tongue (a gory detail that Disney understandably left out) and gives her a pair of legs in exchange. The legs come at a higher cost than just her voice, though. Every step the princess takes will feel as though she’s walking on knives, and once she has taken the form of a human, she will never be able to become a mermaid again. She won’t be able to swim in the depths of the ocean or see her family. And the worst of all the sea witch’s terms: if the mermaid is unable to make the prince fall in love with her, she will die on the first sunrise after he has wed another. Despite all this, the mermaid agrees to the witch’s conditions and goes to win the heart of her handsome prince on her quest for true love.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately for the Little Mermaid, it’s not quite the happy ending she was expecting. Instead of the prince falling in love with the mermaid, he mistakenly falls for another maiden. The little mermaid is heartbroken and can only watch as her time runs out to capture the heart of the prince. On the last evening of the mermaid’s life, her sisters rise out of the sea to tell her that they’ve struck a deal with the sea witch. The mermaid’s sisters exchanged their hair for an enchanted knife. Giving the knife to the mermaid, they tell her that she must plunge the blade into her prince’s heart and allow his blood to drip onto her feet. They will then grow together again as a fishtail and she’ll be allowed to return to the ocean. The mermaid loves the prince so much that she can’t bring herself to end his life, and so instead she throws the enchanted knife out to sea and dives in after it, sacrificing herself. As dawn arrives, the mermaid is reduced to sea foam. </p>
